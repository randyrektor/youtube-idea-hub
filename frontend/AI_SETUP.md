## 🔑 Setup Steps

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy your API key (it starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Start Backend Server (Recommended for Performance)

For maximum performance, start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
npm run dev
```

This provides **2-4x faster** AI operations via HTTP keep-alive connections.

### 3. Configure AI in Settings

You have two options for configuring your API key:

#### Option A: File-Based (Recommended)
1. Create a text file (e.g., `my-api-key.txt`) with just your API key
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button in the top-right corner of the app
3. In the AI Configuration section, click **📁 Select File**
4. Choose your text file containing the API key
5. Click "Save AI Configuration"

#### Option B: Manual Entry
1. Click the **⚙️ Settings** button in the top-right corner of the app
2. In the AI Configuration section, click **✏️ Paste Manually**
3. Paste your API key in the input field
4. Click "Save AI Configuration"

### 4. Start Using AI Features

Once configured, all AI features will be automatically available throughout the app.

## 📁 File Format Requirements

When using the file-based option:
- **File type**: `.txt`, `.key`, or `.env` files
- **Content**: Just your API key, no extra text or formatting
- **Format**: Must start with `sk-`
- **Example**: See `example-api-key.txt` in the project root

**Good example:**
```
sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

**Bad examples:**
```
API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
OpenAI Key: sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Backend integration** provides additional security layer
- **Never share your API key** or commit it to version control

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "AI Features Not Configured" Error
- Click the ⚙️ Settings button in the top-right corner
- Verify your API key is entered correctly
- Check that the key validation was successful
- Ensure you have sufficient OpenAI credits

### Backend Connection Issues
- Ensure backend server is running on port 3001
- Check console for connection errors
- Frontend will automatically fall back to direct OpenAI calls
- Verify firewall/network settings

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your account type
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits
- Backend integration helps manage rate limits more efficiently

### Slow Responses
- **Backend**: AI analysis takes 1-6 seconds for 100 ideas
- **Frontend**: AI analysis takes 5-15 seconds for 100 ideas
- **Title Generation**: 0.5-2 seconds with caching
- Check your internet connection and backend status

### Key Validation Issues
- Ensure your API key starts with `sk-`
- Check that you have an active OpenAI account
- Verify you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account
- Try testing your key at [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)
