# üé¨ YouTube Title Scoring Guide (for Cursor Agent)

This document describes how to analyze and score YouTube video titles with the OpenAI API using a weighted rubric. It is designed so you can copy-paste directly into Cursor to guide the agent when implementing features.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Weighted Scoring Framework (30/30/40)

### 30% Topic Momentum (Trend Proxy)

- Uses model prior knowledge (no live browsing).
- Factors: evergreen vs seasonal topics, audience demand, competitive saturation.

### 30% Channel Fit (History / Analytics)

- Similarity to top-performing past videos (views, CTR, retention).
- Audience alignment (beginner vs advanced).
- Consistency with your proven formats.

### 40% Title & Idea Strength

- **CTR Potential (20%)**: clarity, curiosity gap, benefit-driven phrasing.
- **Clarity/Scope (10%)**: sharply defined, not vague.
- **Novelty/Angle (5%)**: fresh vs your back catalog.
- **Feasibility (5%)**: realistic to produce with your usual effort.

## üìù Prompt Template

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an assistant that scores YouTube video titles for likely success using a weighted rubric.
Only return valid JSON. No prose. Use integers 0‚Äì100 for all sub-scores.
We‚Äôll compute totals client-side.

RUBRIC (weights):
- Topic Momentum (30%): model prior on general interest/seasonality + competitiveness (no live browsing).
- Channel Fit (30%): similarity to the user‚Äôs past top performers and audience preferences.
- Title & Idea Strength (40% total):
  - CTR Potential 20% (clarity, specificity, curiosity gap, value prop)
  - Clarity/Scope 10% (focused, not vague)
  - Novelty/Angle 5% (fresh vs back catalog)
  - Feasibility 5% (can be produced with typical effort)

OUTPUT JSON:
{
  "scores": [
    {
      "title": "<title>",
      "topicMomentum": <0-100>,
      "channelFit": <0-100>,
      "ctrPotential": <0-100>,
      "clarityScope": <0-100>,
      "noveltyAngle": <0-100>,
      "feasibility": <0-100>,
      "notes": "<<=20 words>>"
    }
  ]
}

USER CONTEXT (channel summary):
<paste 5‚Äì10 bullet lines: top video titles + why they worked (views/CTR/retention),
audience level, preferred lengths, successful formats>

TITLES TO SCORE (100 lines, one per line):
<title 1>
<title 2>
...
<title 100>
```

## üßÆ Final Score Calculation (done client-side)

```js
function computeScore(entry) {
  const titleStrength = 0.20*entry.ctrPotential
                      + 0.10*entry.clarityScope
                      + 0.05*entry.noveltyAngle
                      + 0.05*entry.feasibility;

  return 0.30*entry.topicMomentum + 0.30*entry.channelFit + 0.40*titleStrength;
}
```

## üí∞ Token/Cost Estimates (gpt-4o-mini)

- Input: \~2‚Äì3k tokens (rubric + 100 titles + channel summary).
- Output: \~2‚Äì3k tokens (JSON scores + short notes).
- Cost: **< \$0.01 per 100 titles**.

Use batching (all titles at once) to avoid paying for duplicate instructions.

---

## üîß Implementation Tips

- **Batch** all 100 titles in one request.
- **Clamp** `max_tokens` (\~1500‚Äì2500).
- **Short notes only**: instruct model `<= 20 words`.
- **Do weighting math client-side** so you can tweak weights without re-running.
- **Cache** results so reloading the app doesn‚Äôt re-trigger costs.
